# Curriculum

- [Final project](#final-project)

## Final project

Part of learning is doing.
The assignments and exams for each course are to prepare you to use your knowledge to solve real-world problems.

After you've completed Core CS and the parts of Advanced CS relevant to you,
you should identify a problem that you can solve using the knowledge you've acquired.
You can create something entirely new, or you can improve some tool/program that you use and wish were better.

Students who would like more guidance in creating a project may choose to use a series of project oriented courses.
Here is a sample of options
(many more are available, at this point you should be capable of identifying a series that is interesting and relevant to you):
